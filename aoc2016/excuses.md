I'm not super familiar with C tooling (and every experience I've had with it has been god awful). So everything in this year is gonna look like jank garbage, including the code because I find pointer casting endlessly fun. I'm mostly here to code without all the fancy modern bells and whistles, so it is what it is.

I know you're not "supposed" to put implementations in header files, but i'm not making *50* files for 2 throwaway functions a piece.

No I don't know how makefiles work, this one was auto generated and puts object files into the src folder instead of the output folder. Iunno. I tried fiddling with it a little but whatever. Maybe soon i'll care enough to learn and fix it. Maybe. Everything i've read and heard about makefiles (including and especially CMake) have made me not want to bother.
